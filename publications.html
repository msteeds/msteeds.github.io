	<p class="abstract">Abstract:</p>
	<p class="abstract">Inclusivity is key to all research, but particularly that with as strong a human focus as HCI.
	It's important for not only our research community but also to ensure the research we conduct is as inclusive as possible and considers all types of human and their interactions with technology.
	In particular, socio- economic status is a global aspect of inclusion that prevents people of low income backgrounds from getting involved in computer science and CHI.
	In countries like the UK that barrier disproportionately effects BME people, leading to higher education and academia to be predominantly white.
	Furthermore, gender is a well-known barrier in scientific disciplines.
	However, non-binary identities and unique challenges faced by trans researchers are important to consider when making a safe and inclusive community for everyone.
	Understanding gender and sex as different terms can also be beneficial in ensuring research is accurately measuring phenomena.
	These issues are discussed from the perspective of a new member of CHI community, with limited experience of global academia.</p>
