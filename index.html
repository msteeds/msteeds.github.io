<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Manchester in the Department of Computer Science. My research focusses on the impact of technology on human memory.
In particular, I am interested in whether the way a device is perceived impacts cognitive processes.
I am also interested in the ways memory can be aided by technology in different populations.</p>

<p>Prior to studying at the University of Manchester, I completed an Mpsych, Bsc in Advanced Psychology at the University of Leeds.
Due to my background in psychology, I am interested in the application of psychological principles to the study of Human-Computer interaction.</p>
