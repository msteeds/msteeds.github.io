	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University College Dublin (UCD). I work with the School of Business and School of 
		Information and Communication Studies.
		My research focusses on whether gendered voice assistants (such as Amazon's Alexa) promote gender stereotypes.
		I am further interested in how technolgoy can impact cognition, and the impact of stereotyping technology.
	I am also interested in the ways memory can be aided by technology in different populations.</p>

	<p>Prior to working at UCD, I was an associate lecturer at the University of York where I taught psychology in education.
		Prior my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, I completed an Mpsych, Bsc in Advanced Psychology at
		 the University of Leeds.
	Due to my background in psychology, I am interested in the application of psychological principles to the study of Human-Computer interaction.</p>

	<h3>Projects</h3>
	<p>I am currently a co-investigator on the Queer Joy as a Digital Good project, funded by the <a href="https://digitalgood.net/"> Digital Good Network</a>.</p>
	<p>I previously worked on <a href="https://pactman.uk/">PACTMAN</a>, particularly looking a pervasive environments and human memory.</p>
